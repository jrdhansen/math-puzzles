# 2026 Monthly Math Puzzles

https://momath.org/mindbenders/

> Challenge your mind with monthly puzzles submitted by Peter Winkler and shared on YouTube by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown).  Each month, Peter will also host a short Zoom session to explore the solutions together.  Groups are invited to puzzle together and send a photo; one lucky group each month will be highlighted online and receive a special gift from MoMath.  Get together with friends to discuss, debate, and solve — then send a fun photo of your puzzle party.  MoMath will post photos online and one lucky group each month will be selected to receive a special gift from MoMath.
