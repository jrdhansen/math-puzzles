Solve the ladybug clock puzzle, YouTube video explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t3jZ2xGOvYg).  

A ladybug lands on the 12 of a clock, and every second she moves randomly to a neighboring number, either one step clockwise or one step counterclockwise.  
As soon as she lands on a number we mark that number as visited, continuing until every number has been visited.  

What is the probability that the very last number to get visited is the number 6?
